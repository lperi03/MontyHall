# MontyHall
A visualizer of the probability of success for the Monty Hall problem with 3 doors. Users can choose to try 2 strategies: switch your choice every time
or to never switch. The code shows that depending on your choice, the probability of winning the game converges to 0.67 or 0.33 respectively. There is a plot 
attached in the repo that shows the convergence for the always switching strategy.
